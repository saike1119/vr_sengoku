Includes:

- Prebuilt Castle Layout
- Textures
- 20 castle pieces

Notes:

- If on first import your castle is shaded funny, please change the "normals" import setting on each mesh to "calculate" instead of "import".  This can be found by clicking on the individual mesh pieces and looking in the inspector window.

- Use Unity's inbuilt "snap to vertex" move transform to snap the different wall pieces together properly.

Scene requires pro to look like the screenshots - otherwise will still work just without the post effects.
